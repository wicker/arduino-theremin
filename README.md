Creating MIDI files from a Maxbotix LV-EZ4 and Arduino

- The Avicii song MIDI is the reference song. 

- Stripped out as much of the header as possible in minimal.csv.

- Wrote a simple Arduino script for the Maxbotix LV-EZ4 rangefinder to generate the serial output format.

- Copied and pasted (sorry) from that into a CSV file and applied the csvmidi script from <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/midicsv/">Fourmilab</a>.

- Played the result using timidity.
